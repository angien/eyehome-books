# eyehome-books

Requires a server because there are AJAX requests to load the books. CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTS .TXT FILES!

# How to add a book:

- add the .txt file to the public/books/ directory

- add the title of the book (the text file's exact name) without the '.txt' to books.txt inside the public/ folder to a new line

# Future features:

- Flip to page - top option?

- Bookmark a page (requires saving information somewhere) - engage?
